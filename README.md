# Nutrition

<strong>Main Pages</strong>
There will be three pages to this project: the main page where the user can see a table that contains all foods on their plate as well as a smaller table at the bottom that summarizes their nutrition, another page that resembles a form to select foods to add to the table, and another page view each foodâ€™s nutritional information. We will implement this app in JavaScript.
